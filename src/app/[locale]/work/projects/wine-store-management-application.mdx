## Overview

Management application for a passionate oenologist (SaaS prototype) designed to modernize the management of a wine business, replacing complex Excel and VBA tools with a modern, scalable solution.

## Key Features

-   **Stock Management**: Comprehensive inventory tracking system for wine collections with detailed information about each product.
-   **Order & Invoice Management**: Streamlined process for managing orders and generating professional invoices.
-   **Client Portfolio**: Centralized client database with relationship history and preferences.
-   **Administrative Automation**: 100% automation of previously manual administrative tasks.
-   **Intuitive Interface**: Modern UI/UX designed specifically for wine professionals.

## Technologies Used

-   **Next.js**: For building a fast, server-rendered React application.
-   **React**: For creating a responsive and interactive user interface.
-   **TailwindCSS**: For efficient and consistent styling across the application.
-   **PostgreSQL**: For robust and scalable data management.
-   **Vercel**: For secure and reliable cloud deployment.

## Challenges and Learnings

A significant challenge was translating complex Excel-based workflows into an intuitive web application while ensuring all industry-specific requirements were met. The solution involved close collaboration with the client to understand the nuances of wine management and iterative development to refine the user experience. This project reinforced the importance of domain knowledge when building specialized business applications.

## Outcome

The application successfully launched in 2024 as a market-testing prototype with five main modules: stocks, orders, clients, invoices, and pricing. The solution has completely automated administrative tasks, allowing the oenologist to focus on relationships with winegrowers in France and abroad. The SaaS model is now ready for testing by other wine professionals, with potential for market expansion.
