At 30, I made a decision that would change my life: leaving my job as a store manager to embark on a career change journey into web development. Today, I want to share this adventure with you, its challenges and successes.

## Who Am I?

My name is Yann THOBENA, I'm 34 years old, and at 30, I decided to leave my job as a store manager in a small company selling welding equipment in Toulouse.

<br />
<br />
I've always been determined, but it took me a long time to accept that I might
have chosen the wrong career path. It took even more courage to leave the
stability of a job and go back to school… especially since I was never the best
student!

## Finding My New Path

I wanted a job that would excite me every morning. I've always spent a lot of time on my PC, gaming, streaming… So why not turn this into a career?

<br />
<br />
That's when I discovered coding. I took a few HTML and CSS courses online, and
it felt like a revelation! Without any financial support from the state and no
severance package, I quit my job to start my new journey.

            label: 'JavaScript',
            language: 'js',
        },
    ]}

## Training: A Risky but Rewarding Bet

I found O'Clock, an online coding school, and everything looked amazing! I passed their tests, including a motivation video (which wasn't easy to do!), and got accepted.

<br />
<br />
For six months, I followed an intensive coding bootcamp, right in the middle of
COVID and lockdown. Honestly, I had the perfect excuse to stay inside! I fell in
love with coding, to the point where I extended my training with 16 months of
apprenticeship to earn my Software Developer degree (equivalent to a Bachelor's
degree).

## Breaking Into the Industry: A Challenge!

The hardest part? Finding a company… But in the end, the company found me! Marie, from Ipanova, reached out, and I joined their team specializing in:

-   SAP ERP
-   Data
-   Custom web applications

I had the perfect environment to grow in my new career. However, my biggest challenge was the imposter syndrome. It kept creeping in, even though I was surrounded by supportive colleagues.

## My Growth and Skills Development

Today, I'm proud of how far I've come! I've built end-to-end applications and even explored DevOps (which seemed super complex at first). I often asked colleagues to draw things for me to understand technical concepts. 😆

<br />
<br />
I've mastered:

-   UI/UX design with Figma 🎨
-   Database architecture 🗄️
-   Tech stack selection 🔍
-   SEO optimization 📈
-   CI/CD deployment with Docker 🐳

And so much more… I sometimes wish days were 48 hours long to learn everything!

## Combining Development and Sales Background

Thanks to my sales background, I've deepened my knowledge in web marketing and SEO. Today, I apply these skills at Ipanova, where I've even proposed a website redesign project (a good old site with spaghetti code 🍝).

<br />
<br />
This project will be built with Next.js and Payload CMS, a stack that seems very
promising to me... But that will be for the next episode! 😉
