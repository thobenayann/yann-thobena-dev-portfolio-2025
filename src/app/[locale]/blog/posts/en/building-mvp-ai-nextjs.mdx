# Building a Web App MVP in 24 Hours with AI & Next.js

As a **Web Developer at Ipanova**, I love tackling technical challenges, and this story is one of my recent adventures in the field. It all started with a call from an old client who had already built a **React app for wine tasting** as part of their **wine tasting experience box**.

<br />
<br />
Their app is still up and running, but now they were looking into **a new
business model**, shifting towards B2B and AI-driven experiences.

## üìû The Unexpected Callback

When I first reached out to catch up, the answer was expected: no budget for their current app‚Äôs evolution. Instead, they had a new idea : a **PWA (Progressive Web App)** aimed at delivering an ultra-immersive experience, leveraging AI but **without going through the App Stores**.

<br />
<br />
Sounds exciting, right? Even better, their **technical co-founder was already
using Next.js and AI tools like Cursor** (my own preferred stack!).

<br />
<br />
The call ended with the usual: "We‚Äôll handle the MVP internally for now." No
surprise. Still, I was glad to reconnect, chat about AI and development trends,
and exchange some thoughts on **how AI-powered apps are reshaping the
industry**.

## ‚è≥ A Weekend Later‚Ä¶ Change of Plans!

Monday morning, I get a call back. "Hey, actually, let's set up a **scoping workshop** and get a quote for the MVP!" Boom. The door was open. Time to seize the opportunity.

### üî• The Challenge: Build a Working MVP Demo in 24 Hours

From past experience‚Äîboth as a **developer and former sales rep**, i knew something crucial: if the client can **see and interact with a real prototype**, they will be much more likely to **commit to the project**.

<br />
<br />
Then it hit me: I see developers posting insane AI-powered builds all the time.
Why not **challenge myself to build a working MVP demo in just one day**? Not
just wireframes or a Figma prototype, but a real **clickable, testable
version**.
<br />
<br />
This would serve two purposes:

1. **Give the client a real feel of the application.**
2. **Ensure we gather solid requirements in the process.**

## üõ†Ô∏è The Tech Stack: AI-Powered Development

My secret weapons? **Cursor, Next.js, ShadcnUI, and Vercel AI SDK**. Here‚Äôs how I broke it down:

### üìú 1. Defining Clear Rules & Context

Cursor allows developers to **define "rules" in `.mdc` files**. This helps AI understand:

-   The **syntax** and **coding standards** I expect.
-   The **frameworks** and **libraries** in use.
-   The **style and conventions** for the project.

<br />
Additionally, Cursor lets you **feed it documentation links as global project parameters**,
making it even more powerful.

### ü§ñ 2. Structured AI Prompts for Each Feature

Instead of just "asking AI to code," I **carefully prepared prompts** for every feature, providing:

-   **Feature details** (functional & technical).
-   **User interactions** and expected **UI behavior**.
-   **Screens & styles**, ensuring consistency across the app.

Each prompt acted as a "blueprint," allowing **AI-assisted pair programming** to be highly efficient.

### üèéÔ∏è 3. Rapid AI-Powered Development

Armed with **ChatGPT and Cursor**, I ran through the prompts, iterating fast. The AI handled the bulk of repetitive coding while I **fine-tuned logic, integrations, and UI tweaks**.

One of the most exciting moments? **Integrating an OpenAI-powered chat feature** into the app. Thanks to **Next.js, ShadcnUI, and Vercel AI SDK**, it was surprisingly simple‚Äîand the results were beyond promising.

## üèÅ The Final Touch: Presentation & Strategy

After a **day of coding**, I took time to:

-   **Fix minor bugs & polish interactions.**
-   **Prepare a structured demo walkthrough** for the upcoming workshop.
-   **Ensure the user journey for all 3 roles in the app was clear.**

In the end, the biggest takeaway wasn‚Äôt just **how fast AI can boost development**, but how **critical well-defined specs and user projection are in the success of any project**. If the client can **see their vision come to life**, they are far more likely to **trust us with the full build**.

## üéØ Lessons Learned

1. **AI-assisted development is a game changer** if you know how to guide it.
2. **A structured approach (rules, prompts, context) leads to significantly better AI output.**
3. **Clients love seeing tangible results**‚Äînot just pitch decks and mockups.
4. **Having a technical conversation with someone using the same stack is rare and priceless!**

In the end, taking risks and pushing for innovative approaches is what makes this job **so damn exciting**.
