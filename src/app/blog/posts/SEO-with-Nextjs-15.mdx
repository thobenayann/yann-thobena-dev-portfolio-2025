# SEO with Next.js 15: How to Optimize Your Web Applications in 2025?

As a web developer at **Ipanova**, my daily work involves building custom web applications, integrating ERP systems like SAP Business One, and working on Business Intelligence solutions. But beyond pure development, one of my current challenges is revamping and optimizing **Ipanova's** website to improve its search engine ranking.

<br />
<br />
Even in B2B, SEO remains essential. Let's dive into why and how to do it
efficiently with Next.js 15.

## 🕵️‍♂️ SEO: A Must for B2B Visibility

SEO (Search Engine Optimization) helps improve your website's visibility in search engine results like Google, making it easier for potential customers to find you—without relying on paid ads.

In B2B, buying cycles are longer, decisions involve multiple stakeholders, and financial stakes are higher. A solid SEO strategy reassures potential clients of your expertise and encourages engagement.

## 🛠️ Next.js 15: Your SEO Powerhouse

Next.js 15 is now one of the best frameworks for SEO. Here are some must-know techniques:

### 📍 Clean URLs with File-Based Routing

Next.js 15 uses a simple file-based routing system to structure URLs effectively:

<CodeBlock
    className='my-24'
    compact
    codeInstances={[
        {
            code: '// app/services/[service]/page.js\nexport default function ServicePage({ params }) {\n    return <h1>Our expertise in {params.service}</h1>;\n}',
            label: 'Next.js',
            language: 'jsx',
        },
    ]}
    copyButton
/>

Which generates a clean URL:

<br />
<br />
**yoursite.com/services/erp-sap-integration**
<br />
<br />
Great for SEO and user experience!

### 📝 Dynamic Metadata for Maximum Impact

Next.js 15 simplifies metadata handling (titles, descriptions, Open Graph tags), which are crucial for SEO:

<CodeBlock
    className='my-24'
    compact
    codeInstances={[
        {
            code: "export const metadata = {\n    title: 'Ipanova - SAP Business One & Web Development Experts',\n    description:\n        'We build custom web applications and integrate SAP Business One to enhance your aerospace supply chain.',\n    openGraph: {\n        title: 'Ipanova - SAP Business One & Web Development Experts',\n        description:\n            'Discover our tailored solutions for aerospace supply chain optimization.',\n        images: ['/images/og-image-ipanova.jpg'],\n    },\n};",
            label: 'Next.js',
            language: 'jsx',
        },
    ]}
    copyButton
/>

### 🌐 Optimizing Performance with SSR, SSG, and ISR

Next.js offers multiple rendering strategies:

-   **SSR (Server Side Rendering)** for highly dynamic content.
-   **SSG (Static Site Generation)** for pages with fixed content.
-   **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)** for semi-dynamic content that updates periodically.

Using the right rendering method improves performance and SEO.

### 🗺️ Auto-Generate Your Sitemap

A structured sitemap helps search engines index your website properly.

With Next.js 15, you can generate a sitemap automatically using [`next-sitemap`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/sitemap):

<CodeBlock
    className='my-8'
    compact
    codeInstances={[
        {
            code: 'npm install next-sitemap',
            label: 'terminal',
            language: 'shell',
        },
    ]}
    copyButton
/>

### 🔍 Robots.txt: Guide Search Engine Crawlers

A `robots.txt` file tells search engines which pages they should or shouldn't crawl. Create one in your `app/robots.txt` folder:

<CodeBlock
    className='my-24'
    compact
    codeInstances={[
        {
            code: 'User-agent: *\nAllow: /\nDisallow: /admin\nSitemap: https://yoursite.com/sitemap.xml',
            label: 'robots.txt',
            language: 'txt',
        },
    ]}
    copyButton
/>

### 🎨 Favicons: Small but Powerful!

Favicons enhance user experience and strengthen brand identity. Use a tool like [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) to create high-quality icons in various formats.

## 📊 Must-Have SEO Tools

Some of the best SEO tools I use:

-   [**SERPmantics**](https://www.serpmantics.com/) for semantic content analysis.
-   [**Google Search Console**](https://search.google.com/search-console) for indexing and performance tracking.
-   [**Ubersuggest**](https://app.neilpatel.com/en/ubersuggest/) for keyword research and competition analysis.
